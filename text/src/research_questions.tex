My work evaluates the following questions:

\begin{itemize}[label=$\bullet$]
    \item \textbf{RQ1:} Does using specialized processor instructions (like AVX512, BMI2) allow us to significantly reduce the constant factor in $O(1)$ access time?
    \item \textbf{RQ2:} How much does limiting to fixed key lengths help in optimizing MMPH? How does it affect the final metadata size?
    \item \textbf{RQ3:} Is that possible to write \textit{branchless} algorithm for Trie traversal? What impact does a \textit{branchless} approach to Trie traversal have on the filter`s overall throughput?
    \item \textbf{RQ4:} Is it possible to implement the purely theoretical Hollow Z Fast Trie structure efficiently enough to be competitive?
    \item \textbf{RQ5:} What is the minimum achievable memory overhead when implementing Hollow Trie compared to the theoretical information limit?
    \item \textbf{RQ6:} How do specific key distribution patterns (e.g., clustering) affect the FP probability in Hollow Trie?
\end{itemize}
